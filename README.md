Hi there, I’m Frank! 👋

Bio
____________________________________________________
I specialize in full stack development, where I use my creativity and technical knowledge to craft visually appealing user interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience through interaction with the backend. When I'm not coding, I enjoy travelling and meeting new people to establish new connections. I emphasize the importance of approaching technology with empathy and a human touch, as I believe this is what sets great developers apart. Welcome to my world 🌍, where design 🎨 and humanity 👏🏾 meet to create amazing user experiences!
